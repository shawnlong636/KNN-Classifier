The goal of this project is to use the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to create an unspervised ML model for a data set. To improve the model, a validator is provided to evaluate the classifier, which can then be used with feature selection to narrow down the features to a more accurate subset of features.

## Usage

To run the app, simply run the following command from the project root:

```bash
python main.py
```

To run the app tests, run:

```
python main.py --test
```

or

```
python main.py -t
```

To run the app and tests at the same time, run:

```
python main.py --test --continue
```

or

```
python main.py -t -c
```
